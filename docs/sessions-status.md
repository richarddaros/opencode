# Sessions screen: status model, icons, and decisions

Design record for the cross-project sessions list (`opencode sessions`). It
covers the status state machine, the icon/color language, and the product
decisions taken with the maintainer. Implementation lives in:

- `packages/core/src/session/status-store.ts` — persisted statuses (SQLite `session_status` table)
- `packages/opencode/src/session/status.ts` — runtime → persisted mirroring (serialized write queue)
- `packages/opencode/src/session/status-derive.ts` — writer-liveness derivation
- `packages/tui/src/util/session-status.ts` — status resolution, labels, icons, colors
- `packages/tui/src/routes/sessions.tsx` — the screen itself

## Status states and icons

Every row may carry a gutter icon and a footer label that share one color.

| Icon    | Label         | Meaning                                                                    | Set when                                                                            | Expires                                                              |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| spinner | `Working`     | A turn is running in a live process                                        | runtime busy, or persisted `working` with a live writer PID                         | becomes `✕ Interrupted` when the writer dies                         |
| `⚠`    | `Retrying`    | The provider call is being retried                                         | runtime retry, or persisted `retrying` with a live writer PID                       | same as above                                                        |
| `!`     | `Needs input` | A question/permission **tool** is blocked waiting for you                  | `question.asked` / `permission.asked` (runtime always wins)                         | never — clears when you reply; becomes plain idle if the writer dies |
| `?`     | `Waiting`     | The turn **completed** with the assistant's last line asking you something | `setIdle` heuristic: completed assistant message whose last text line ends with `?` | never — fades but stays until you reply                              |
| `✓`     | `Done`        | The turn completed without asking anything                                 | `setIdle`: completed assistant message, no trailing `?`                             | label/icon disappear after 30 min                                    |
| `✕`     | `Interrupted` | The process behind an active status is gone                                | derived at read time: persisted `working`/`retrying` with a dead writer PID         | rewritten on the next real transition                                |
| —       | (none)        | Idle or nothing to say                                                     | everything else                                                                     | —                                                                    |

Precedence (highest first): runtime pending question/permission → runtime
busy/retry → persisted row. The persisted `detail` shows next to the title:
the question for `Waiting`, the question header for `Needs input`, the first
line of the last reply for `Done`, the retry reason for `Retrying`.

## Color bands ("cache heat")

Colors communicate how long ago the status last changed, aligned with
provider prompt-cache windows so hot sessions stand out:

| Age                                    | Rendering                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| < 5 min (inside the default cache TTL) | strong type color (warning/success/primary/error) |
| 5–60 min (extended-cache window)       | color tinted ~55% towards the background          |
| > 60 min                               | muted gray                                        |

Terminals cannot vary glyph size, so "fading over time" is expressed through
color intensity plus, for `Done`, expiry. `Waiting` and `Needs input` never
expire — a pending reply should never silently vanish.

## Decisions (discovery, 2026-07-27)

All recorded in the discovery session
`~/.agents/skills/discovery-interview/scripts/discovery-sessions/28efc353-f6bf-494a-a3c3-878d48d28c3f`.
Every recommendation was accepted:

1. **Detection of "waiting for the user"**: heuristic — the completed turn's
   last non-empty text line ends with `?`. Cheap (runs where the `Done`
   detail was already computed), covers the reported case, and false
   positives are low-cost (a `Done` shows as `Waiting`).
2. **Label**: `Waiting` — reads as "your turn" without colliding with
   `Needs input` (blocked on a tool).
3. **Indicator placement**: gutter icon for every status, next to the
   existing spinner slot; the footer keeps the text label.
4. **Time bands**: 3 bands — `<5min`, `5–60min`, `>60min` — matching the
   default and extended prompt-cache TTLs.
5. **Aging on the icon**: color intensity (typed glyphs have no meaningful
   "fill" axis; size does not exist in a terminal).
6. **Glyph set**: plain Unicode — `? ! ✓ ⚠ ✕` + the existing spinner.
   No Nerd Font dependency.
7. **`Waiting` expiry**: never; it only fades, like `Needs input`.

Related earlier decisions: status writes are serialized through a single
queue (no lost updates), writers stamp their PID and readers derive
`Interrupted` from writer liveness (no false "interrupted" for sessions
alive in other terminals), and question/permission finalizers persist the
runtime status so dropped requests don't leave stale `Needs input` rows.

## LLM turn classification (implemented behind a flag)

The `?` heuristic remains the default, but an LLM classifier can label the
completed turn instead. Enable with `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_STATUS_CLASSIFIER=1`
(or `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`). When the loop exits, the completed assistant
text is classified by the built-in hidden `status-classifier` agent — its
prompt and model are overridable via config, exactly like the `title` agent
— using the agent's configured model, the provider's small model, or the
session's own model as fallback. The verdict is registered inline before the
runner reports idle, so the next `setIdle` consumes it deterministically
(`store.setIdle(sessionID, { verdict })`), with the heuristic as fallback on
any failure or a 15s timeout. Feasibility was proven on this machine with a
local Ollama `qwen3:4b-instruct`: 3/3 correct at ~100–150 ms per call.

Config example for a fully local classifier:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "status-classifier": { "model": "ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct" }
  }
}
```

## First-turn retitle (implemented)

The title is written exactly once: when a turn completes with the title still
at its default, the `title` agent generates it from the whole conversation. An
aborted first turn leaves the default title until the next completed turn, and
a manually renamed title is never overwritten. Every title write (LLM or
manual rename) is recorded in `session_title_history` with its source.
