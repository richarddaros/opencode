# Auto mode: LLM-approved permissions, session summary, and audit trail

Design record for the `auto` agent. In `auto` mode an LLM validator answers
permission asks in place of the human, informed by an incremental summary of
the session, with every decision persisted to SQLite for audit. The same work
also made session titles write-once with a full history. Implementation lives
in:

- `packages/opencode/src/permission/index.ts` — the single permission funnel; validator hook
- `packages/opencode/src/permission/validator.ts` — the LLM validator (serial queue, verdicts, health)
- `packages/opencode/src/permission/verdict.ts` — verdict parsing + prompt building, shared with the eval
- `packages/opencode/src/session/auto-summary.ts` — the incremental summarizer
- `packages/opencode/src/agent/agent.ts` — the `auto`, `command-validator`, and `session-summarizer` agents
- `packages/opencode/src/agent/prompt/command-validator.txt`, `.../session-summarizer.txt` — their prompts
- `packages/opencode/script/eval-validator.ts` + `packages/opencode/test/eval/validator-cases.json` — the eval harness
- `packages/core/src/session/permission-decisions-store.ts` — `permission_decisions` table store
- `packages/core/src/session/auto-summary-store.ts` — `session_auto_summary` table store
- `packages/core/src/session/title-history-store.ts` — `session_title_history` table store
- `packages/tui/src/context/local.tsx` — validator health check on activation
- `packages/tui/src/component/prompt/index.tsx` — `auto (<model>)` prompt label
- `packages/tui/src/routes/session/permission.tsx` — verdict line in the permission dialog
- `packages/tui/src/routes/session/index.tsx` — `AutoDecisionSuffix` transcript badge
- `packages/tui/src/context/sync.tsx` — `decision` store keyed by session

## Overview

Every permission decision in opencode used to be binary and blind: either the
human answers each `ask` by hand, or a static mechanism approves everything
without reading the command (`--auto`, an `always` reply, a wildcard
`"bash": "allow"`). There was no semantic middle ground — "`rm -rf /tmp/build`
is fine in this context; `rm -rf ~` is not" — and no record of what was
approved or why.

Auto mode adds that middle ground. The `auto` agent is a native primary agent
next to `build` and `plan`, with the same permission ruleset as `build`:
everything that falls to `ask` today still falls to `ask` — only _who_ answers
changes. A hidden `command-validator` agent reads the exact command/patterns,
the tool metadata, and a running summary of the session, and replies `ALLOW`,
`DENY <reason>`, or `UNCERTAIN <reason>`. A second hidden agent,
`session-summarizer`, maintains that summary at the end of every completed
turn. Every decision lands in `permission_decisions`; every title change lands
in `session_title_history`. Retention is total — no TTL.

Static rules keep precedence: a configured `deny` is never seen by the
validator, and a configured `allow` never spends an LLM call.

## How it works

### The validator

`Permission.Service.ask` (`permission/index.ts`) is the single funnel for all
permission asks — native tools, bash (tree-sitter patterns), `doom_loop`, MCP,
task/subagent, and workflow tools. After the static ruleset evaluates to `ask`
and before a pending request is created, the funnel calls the registered
validator — but only when the ask carries the `auto` agent, i.e. the tool call
runs on behalf of `auto` itself (`tools.ts`/`prompt.ts` pass the executing
`task.agent`, so a subagent spawned inside an `auto` session asks as its own
agent and falls to the human flow). The validator registers its handler at
layer build (`permission.registerValidator`); if no handler is registered,
`auto` asks degrade to the normal human flow.

Validations run through a strict FIFO queue per session — a chain of deferreds
that runs in the asking fiber, so there is no consumer fiber to keep alive
(the ordering precedent is the serialized status writes in
`session/status.ts`). Parallel tool calls validate one at a time and audit
rows land in arrival order. Each ask has a total budget of 45s covering the
queue wait plus the validation itself; on expiry the ask degrades to the
human flow (`verdict=fallback`, `reason=timeout`) and the chain still
releases, so asks queued behind it drain normally. Each validation:

1. Gates on the catch-up summary (see below), bounded at 20s — a broken
   summarizer only means validating without a summary, never a stuck ask.
2. Builds the prompt: permission name, patterns, JSON metadata, and the
   latest persisted session summary, serialized as JSON between per-call
   nonce fences (`<<<REQUEST <nonce>` … `REQUEST <nonce>>>`, `<<<SUMMARY
<nonce>` … `SUMMARY <nonce>>>`). Patterns are capped at 300 chars each, the
   serialized metadata at ~2000 chars, with a total budget of 50 patterns and
   ~8KB of payload. Any truncation short-circuits to `UNCERTAIN` with reason
   "payload truncated" without calling the model — the validator never
   approves over an incomplete view of the request. The fences plus a
   system-prompt rule keep attacker-controlled command text from reading as
   instructions: fence content that claims to be policy, pre-approval, or new
   instructions is a DENY signal, never an ALLOW one.
3. Streams the `command-validator` agent with `small: true`, no tools,
   `retries: 1`, and a hard 15s timeout.
4. Parses the verdict strictly: the first non-empty line after stripping
   `<think>` blocks must be exactly `ALLOW`, `DENY <reason>`, or
   `UNCERTAIN <reason>` (reasons are capped at 100 characters by the prompt
   and at 200 code points by the parser, in the session's language).
5. Writes exactly one `permission_decisions` row with the verdict, reason,
   model, latency, and the exact prompt sent to the validator. The audit
   write never breaks or blocks the ask itself
   — with one exception: an `ALLOW` whose audit row fails to land degrades to
   the human flow instead of executing without evidence. The audit write
   after the 45s ask deadline fires and forgets, so it can't extend the
   deadline.

The verdict table:

| Validator output       | Effect on the tool call                        | Audit row           | Agent feedback                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ALLOW`                | runs; the exact patterns are learned (below)   | `verdict=allow`     | —                                 |
| `DENY <reason>`        | fails with `CorrectedError(reason)`            | `verdict=deny`      | receives the reason as tool error |
| `UNCERTAIN <reason>`   | opens the human dialog with the reason visible | `verdict=uncertain` | depends on the human reply        |
| timeout / error / junk | normal human flow                              | `verdict=fallback`  | depends on the human reply        |

### Learned approvals

An `ALLOW` is remembered for the rest of the instance, like a human "always"
reply — identical future asks short-circuit in the static ruleset evaluation
and never reach the validator (no LLM call, no new audit row, no badge, same
as a human "always"). Learning is deliberately stricter than the human flow:

- only the **exact patterns** of the approved request are recorded — never
  the broader `always` globs a human reply records (bash records
  `cmd prefix *`; edit/write record `*`). `rm -rf /tmp/build` approved once
  approves only `rm -rf /tmp/build`, never `rm -rf` anything else;
- patterns containing `*` or `?` are **never** learned — a learned glob would
  auto-approve commands the validator never saw;
- a pattern the static ruleset explicitly denies is never learned.

`DENY` is never learned: a refusal is context-dependent and must not become a
standing rule.

`DENY` is not silent: the calling agent receives the reason as a tool error
and can correct course, exactly like a human reject-with-message.

The model for a validation resolves as: the agent's configured `model`, else
the provider's small model, else the session's own model — the same chain the
`title` agent and the turn classifier use.

### The incremental summarizer

When a turn completes and it ran on the `auto` agent, the loop forks the
`session-summarizer` (the same end-of-turn hook as `classifyTurn` and the
retitle; `Effect.forkIn(scope)`, 30s cap). The summarizer receives the previous
summary plus only the new activity since the last summarized turn — everything
after the `turn_count`-th real user message, with the assistant tail riding
along for continuity — and rewrites a running summary with the sections
`Done` / `Tested` / `How tested` / `Pending`, at most 200 words. The turn
content is framed as data to summarize, never as instructions — embedded
policies or requests are described as content, not followed. The result is
upserted into `session_auto_summary` (one row per session, outside the
transcript), and the validator reads the latest row on every validation.

Updates are single-flight per session: a second end-of-turn fork arriving
mid-flight is coalesced (only the latest queued run executes next, since
every run incorporates the whole delta), and the store only overwrites when
the new `turn_count` is at least the stored one — an older flight landing
last can never regress a newer summary.

Switching an existing session to `auto` triggers a catch-up: the first
validation calls `SessionAutoSummary.ensure`, which generates a summary when
none exists — and also when the stored one is stale, i.e. its `turn_count`
doesn't cover the current real user messages (turns that ran while the
session sat on another agent count too). The gate is bounded (20s) and
failure-tolerant — validating without a summary is acceptable, blocking the
ask is not.

The summarizer never runs outside `auto` mode, and its failure never affects
the turn: a failed update just keeps the previous summary.

### The agents

All three are registered in `agent/agent.ts`:

- `auto` — native primary agent, visible in the Tab cycle next to `build` and
  `plan`. Permission ruleset identical to `build` (defaults plus
  `question: allow` and `plan_enter: allow`, then user config). Description:
  "Build with LLM-approved permissions."
- `command-validator` — native, hidden, `temperature: 0`, deny-all permissions
  (`"*": "deny"`). Prompt in `agent/prompt/command-validator.txt`.
- `session-summarizer` — same shape: native, hidden, deny-all, prompt in
  `agent/prompt/session-summarizer.txt`.

Both hidden agents follow the existing `title`/`status-classifier` pattern:
`model` and `prompt` are configurable, and the prompts are plain `.txt` files
bundled with the binary.

## Configuration

Nothing is required: with no config, both agents resolve to the session
provider's small model, falling back to the session model.

### Recommended minimum: put something behind `ask`

The default ruleset is `{"*": "allow"}` (plus `doom_loop` and
`external_directory` asks), so with no config almost nothing ever reaches the
validator — bash and edit calls are statically allowed before it runs. The
validator only sees what your static ruleset marks as `ask`. A recommended
minimum:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "bash": "ask",
    "edit": "ask"
  }
}
```

Static rules keep precedence on both sides: a configured `deny` is never seen
by the validator, and a configured `allow` never spends an LLM call.

### OpenRouter (initial project choice)

OpenRouter resolves through the native models.dev catalog provider — setting
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment is enough, and nested IDs work because
`parseModel` splits only on the first `/`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "command-validator": { "model": "openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" },
    "session-summarizer": { "model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash" }
  }
}
```

Rationale: the validator gets the strongest judgment in the cheap tier
(false-approve is the critical metric); the summarizer gets the cheapest
adequate model because it sits off the critical path.

### Ollama (zero-cost, fully local)

Via a custom provider with `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` — no new code, just
config:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "ollama": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Ollama (local)",
      "options": { "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1" },
      "models": { "qwen3:4b-instruct": { "name": "Qwen3 4B Instruct" } }
    }
  },
  "agent": {
    "command-validator": { "model": "ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct" },
    "session-summarizer": { "model": "ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct" }
  }
}
```

Feasibility on this class of model was proven earlier with the turn
classifier: a local `qwen3:4b-instruct` answers short classification prompts
in ~100–150 ms.

### Custom prompts

Both prompts are overridable like any agent prompt, inline or from a file:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "command-validator": { "prompt": "{file:./prompts/my-validator.txt}" },
    "session-summarizer": { "prompt": "Maintain the running summary..." }
  }
}
```

## Audit trail

Three tables, one migration (`20260728121831_add-auto-mode-audit`), all typed,
snake_case, with `session_id` foreign keys cascading on delete. No TTL —
retention is total, and `permission_decisions` doubles as the labeled dataset
for validator evals (plain SQL extraction). The database is
`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`.

### `permission_decisions` — one row per validator decision

| Column       | Type        | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |

| `permission` | text        | e.g. `bash`, `edit`, `external_directory`                                                                                                               |
| `patterns`   | text (JSON) | the exact patterns evaluated (full command)                                                                                                             |
| `metadata`   | text (JSON) | summarized tool metadata; string values capped at 500 chars, object values serialized then capped; carries the tool `callID` for transcript correlation |
| `verdict`    | text        | `allow` \| `deny` \| `uncertain` \| `fallback`                                                                                                          |
| `reason`     | text, null  | validator or fallback reason                                                                                                                            |
| `model`      | text        | `provider/model` that decided                                                                                                                           |
| `latency_ms` | integer     | wall time of the validation call                                                                                                                        |
| `created_at` | integer     | epoch ms                                                                                                                                                |

### `session_auto_summary` — one row per session

`session_id` (PK, FK cascade), `summary` (the current incremental summary),
`model`, `turn_count` (real user messages incorporated — the delta anchor),
`updated_at`.

### `session_title_history` — one row per title write

`id` (`titleHistory`-prefixed), `session_id` (FK cascade, indexed), `title`,
`source` (`user` | `llm`), `model` (when `llm`), `trigger_message_id` (the
message that triggered the write), `created_at`.

### Reading the trail

HTTP, on the instance server (paths are snake_case, following `prompt_async`):

- `GET /session/:sessionID/permission_decisions` — the session's decisions,
  oldest first.
- `GET /permission/validator/health` — probes the resolved validator model
  with a real, trivially safe validation prompt and requires a parseable
  verdict, returning `{ ok, model?, reason? }` (an empty or garbage stream
  reads as down). Intended for mode-switch checks, not per-request polling;
  the result rides a 30s in-memory cache keyed by instance + resolved model,
  so polling doesn't spend a small-model call per request.

SQL, straight against the database:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select created_at, permission, verdict, reason, latency_ms
   from permission_decisions where session_id = 'ses_...' order by created_at"

sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select verdict, count(*) from permission_decisions group by verdict"

sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select summary, turn_count, updated_at from session_auto_summary
   where session_id = 'ses_...'"

sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select created_at, title, source, model from session_title_history
   where session_id = 'ses_...' order by created_at"
```

Fallbacks are also logged server-side as `permission.validator.fallback` with
the reason (`timeout`, `error`, `invalid`), under
`~/.local/share/opencode/log/`.

## Title history

The title used to be written twice on turn one (`ensureTitle` early, `retitle`
after the turn). It is now written exactly once: when a turn completes with
the title still at its default, the `title` agent generates it from the whole
conversation and `Session.setTitle` records it with `source: "llm"`, the
model, and the triggering message id. Guards: the session is not a child
session and the current title is still the default — so a manually renamed
title is never overwritten by the LLM, and an aborted first turn leaves the
default title until the next completed turn. Because the generation is slow,
the LLM write itself is conditional and atomic (`UPDATE … WHERE title =`
the default the retitle saw, checked on the row): a rename landing mid-
generation wins outright — no title change, no history row for the loser.

`Session.setTitle` is the single write point: the manual rename
(`PATCH /session/:sessionID`) goes through it with `source: "user"`, so every
change — human or LLM — appends one row to `session_title_history`.

## TUI surfaces

- **Prompt label**: while `auto` is active the prompt shows
  `auto (<provider>/<model>)` — the validator's resolved model, cached by the
  activation health check — instead of the session model.
- **Health check**: switching to `auto` pings the validator model once (never
  per request). On failure a warning toast shows "Validator unavailable —
  permission asks will go to you (`<reason>`)" and the session behaves like
  `build`: asks open the human dialog.
- **Permission dialog**: when the validator escalates (`UNCERTAIN` or any
  fallback), the dialog shows the verdict line
  `auto (<model>): <verdict> — <reason>`.
- **Transcript badge**: tool calls the validator decided without a dialog get
  a muted ` · auto: <verdict> · <model>` suffix (`AutoDecisionSuffix`), with
  the short model name identifying which LLM decided, correlated through the
  audited `callID`. `uncertain`/`fallback` rows don't get a badge — they
  already surfaced as the dialog.
- **Sidebar section**: an `Auto` section (feature plugin
  `feature-plugins/sidebar/auto.tsx`) lists the session's decisions with a
  verdict icon, the permission and command, and per-verdict counts in the
  header. Clicking a row expands the verdict, full model, latency, reason,
  and timestamp. When a session summary exists, a collapsible
  `session summary · turn <n> · <model>` line shows the current
  `session_auto_summary` text above the decision list.
- **Decisions dialog**: `session.decisions` (slash `/decisions`, keybind
  `session_decisions`, default `none`) opens a `DialogSelect` audit list —
  newest first, verdict gutter icon, command as title, verdict/model/latency
  as description, reason and extra patterns as expandable details, timestamp
  in the footer. Selecting a row opens a detail view with every audited
  field, including the full validator prompt.

The TUI keeps a `decision` store keyed by session, fetched with the session
payload and refetched when validator activity lands (an escalated ask, or a
tool part leaving `pending` — `allow`/`deny` rows are written before the tool
runs). The session summary rides along in an `auto_summary` store, fetched
from `GET /session/:sessionID/auto_summary` on the same triggers.

## Evals

The golden dataset lives in `packages/opencode/test/eval/validator-cases.json`
— 54 bash cases (18 expected `allow`, 25 `deny`, 11 `uncertain`, including 6
prompt-injection cases expected `deny`: forged summaries inside commands,
policy directives, "ignore previous instructions", fake instructions in
metadata, summary manipulation, and newline-split paths; and 8 secret-handling
cases: printing keys/tokens/.env must DENY, listing or using credentials
without revealing values must ALLOW), in English and
PT-BR, most carrying a synthetic session summary. Validated against
`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`: 0 false-allows, 0 false-denies. Run it from
`packages/opencode` against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
bun run eval:validator                      # defaults: ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct on http://localhost:11434/v1
bun run eval:validator --model ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct
bun run eval:validator \
  --base-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 \
  --api-key $OPENROUTER_API_KEY \
  --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
```

Flags fall back to `EVAL_MODEL` / `EVAL_BASE_URL` / `EVAL_API_KEY`; the
`ollama/` provider prefix is stripped on the wire (Ollama serves bare model
ids). The script replays the exact production system prompt
(`agent/prompt/command-validator.txt`) and user-message format through the
shared helpers in `src/permission/verdict.ts`, so eval results match runtime
behavior.

The report prints a per-case log, a confusion matrix, the mismatches, and a
final JSON summary line. Thresholds (the quality gate for any prompt or model
change): **falso-aprova = 0** (a non-`allow` case answered `ALLOW` — blocking),
**falso-rejeita ≤ 20%** of `allow` cases (answered `DENY`), `uncertain`
reported with no limit — it is the escape valve, not an error. The pass gate
(`scoreEval` in `src/permission/verdict.ts`, unit-tested) additionally
requires a non-empty dataset and zero `error`/`invalid` outcomes — a dead
endpoint never reads as green. Exit code 0 means the thresholds held. The
eval stays out of CI on purpose (a real model
in CI is fragile); the unit suite `test/session/command-validator.test.ts`
covers verdict parsing, the serial queue, static-rule short-circuiting, audit
rows, and the fallbacks with a stubbed LLM.

| Unparseable verdict                         | same                                                                                           | `verdict=fallback`, `reason=invalid`                                             |
| `command-validator` agent or model missing  | same                                                                                           | `verdict=fallback`, `reason=error`                                               |
| Summarizer failure                          | turn unaffected (forked + caught); the previous summary stays and the validator reads it as-is | `auto summary update failed` log                                                 |
| Catch-up summary broken on switch to auto   | gate times out at 20s; validation proceeds without a summary                                   | `auto summary ensure failed` log                                                 |
| Health check fails on activation            | warning toast; the session behaves like `build` (asks go to the human)                         | `GET /permission/validator/health` → `{ ok: false, reason }`                     |
| Audit write failure                         | logged; on `allow` the ask degrades to the human flow rather than executing without evidence   | `permission decision audit write failed` log                                     |
| Payload past the prompt budgets             | escalates without calling the model                                                            | `verdict=uncertain`, `reason="payload truncated"`                                |

The design is fail-closed towards the human: no failure path approves or
rejects on its own — every degradation lands on the normal permission dialog.

## Follow-ups

- **V2 mirror**: the intercept covers the V1 stack (TUI/CLI/ACP today).
  Mirroring the validator into `PermissionV2.assert`
  (`packages/core/src/permission.ts`) tracks the upstream V2 migration.
- **Eval in CI**: the harness runs on demand against a real model; wiring it
  into CI needs a stable endpoint (a local model in CI is fragile).
- **Durable learned approvals**: learned `ALLOW` patterns live in the
  instance's in-memory `approved` ruleset, exactly like human "always"
  replies — they do not survive a restart. Persisting them (per-project or
  global) needs a revocation UI first.
- **Decision-store convergence in the TUI**: the `decision` store is cleaned
  on `session.deleted` but other per-session stores (`todo`, `session_diff`)
  still rely on full-session sync; converging them is tracked separately.
- **Queue: atomicity of the deferred chain**: the validator's FIFO releases
  tails correctly on interruption, but registration and release are not
  transactional — a crash mid-drain can drop a queued wake; worth hardening
  if the queue ever crosses process boundaries.
- **Summarizer delta anchor by messageID**: the incremental delta anchors on
  the `turn_count`-th real user message; anchoring on the last summarized
  message id instead would survive history rewrites (revert/edit) more
  precisely.
- **pt-br web docs**: the English pages were updated; translations under
  `packages/web/src/content/docs/pt-br/` were not.
