# Feature contributions (fork `richarddaros/opencode`)

Index of the features built on the `sessions-command` branch (merged into
`fork/dev` via PR #1). Deep design records: [auto-mode.md](auto-mode.md) and
[sessions-status.md](sessions-status.md).

## 1. Cross-project sessions screen

Browse, search, and act on sessions across **all** projects, not just the
current one (`opencode sessions`).

- Sessions grouped by project path, with a footer anchored at the selected row.
- Delete sessions directly from the screen.
- Status icons per session (see §3).

```
opencode sessions        # open the cross-project sessions browser
```

## 2. New-session input with `@path` completion

Create a session for another directory without leaving the screen: type `@` to
get fuzzy directory completion anchored at the launch cwd, then confirm to
open a session in that path.

```
@projetos/richard-repositories/opencode<tab>   # fuzzy-matches directories
```

The last-used model and variant are carried into the new session, so you don't
re-pick them per directory.

## 3. Session status model (persisted)

Per-session status that survives restarts, shown as a gutter icon + footer
label with "cache heat" colors (hot <5min, warm 5–60min, cold >60min, aligned
with provider prompt-cache windows).

| Icon    | Label         | Meaning                                                    |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| spinner | `Working`     | a turn is running in a live process                        |
| `⚠`    | `Retrying`    | the provider call is being retried                         |
| `!`     | `Needs input` | a question/permission tool is blocked waiting for you      |
| `?`     | `Waiting`     | the turn completed with the assistant asking you something |
| `✓`     | `Done`        | the turn completed cleanly (expires after 30 min)          |
| `✕`     | `Interrupted` | the process behind an active status is gone                |

Internals: statuses persist to SQLite (`session_status`), writes are
serialized through a single queue, writers stamp their PID, and `Interrupted`
is derived from writer liveness — no false "interrupted" for sessions alive in
other terminals.

### LLM turn classification (experimental)

Replace the trailing-`?` heuristic with an LLM verdict:

```bash
OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_STATUS_CLASSIFIER=1 opencode
```

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "status-classifier": { "model": "ollama/qwen3:4b-instruct" }
  }
}
```

## 4. Session titles: write-once + history + first-turn retitle

- The title is written exactly once: when the first turn completes with the
  title still at its default, the `title` agent generates it from the whole
  conversation.
- An aborted first turn keeps the default title; a manual rename is never
  overwritten.
- Every title write (LLM or manual) is recorded in `session_title_history`
  with its source.

## 5. Auto mode: LLM-approved permissions

A native `auto` primary agent (next to `build` and `plan`) where a hidden
`command-validator` agent answers permission asks semantically instead of the
human — "`rm -rf /tmp/build` is fine in this context; `rm -rf ~` is not".

```
┌ Permission ──────────────────────────┐
│ Bash: rm -rf ~/  ──────────────────  │
│ validator: DENY "deletes home dir"   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Verdicts: `ALLOW` (runs), `DENY <reason>` (the agent gets the reason as a
  tool error and can correct course), `UNCERTAIN <reason>` (opens the human
  dialog with the reason visible); timeout/error/junk degrades to the human
  flow.
- The prompt is fenced with per-call nonces against prompt injection;
  truncated payloads never approve.
- Every decision lands in the `permission_decisions` audit table (verdict,
  reason, model, latency, and the exact prompt sent to the validator) — no
  TTL, and an `ALLOW` whose audit row fails to land degrades to the human
  flow instead of executing without evidence.
- Static rules keep precedence: configured `deny` never reaches the validator;
  configured `allow` never spends an LLM call.

The TUI surfaces validator state: `auto (<model>)` prompt label, verdict line
in the permission dialog, an `Auto` decision badge on approved tool calls in
the transcript, an `Auto` sidebar section with the current session summary
and the decision list, and a `/decisions` dialog whose detail view shows
every audited field including the full validator prompt.

### Eval harness

Golden-dataset eval for the validator, gated on errors and invalid verdicts:

```bash
bun script/eval-validator.ts   # packages/opencode
```

Cases live in `packages/opencode/test/eval/validator-cases.json`.

## 6. Incremental session summaries

A hidden `session-summarizer` agent rewrites a running summary at the end of
every completed turn in `auto` sessions, receiving only the new activity since
the last summarized turn. The validator consumes the latest persisted summary
as context, with a 20s catch-up bound — a broken summarizer means validating
without a summary, never a stuck ask.

## 7. Prompt history recovery + session-aware browsing

Two confirmed double-press gestures (3s window, same pattern as
`esc`-to-interrupt) that stash the typed draft into the prompt history instead
of losing it:

- `esc` with text typed: first press shows `esc again to clear · saves draft`;
  the second press appends the draft to the history and clears the input.
  With an empty input, `esc` keeps its current meaning (double press
  interrupts a running turn).
- `←` with the cursor at the very start of a non-empty input (where left is
  otherwise a no-op): first press arms, the second press stashes the draft,
  clears the input, and navigates back to the sessions list. An empty input
  still goes back immediately.
- `ctrl+c` keeps clearing immediately on the first press. Clears with at least
  20 non-whitespace characters, or with any attachment, are also appended to
  prompt history so a meaningful draft is recoverable; shorter text-only
  clears are not retained.

History entries are tagged with their origin (`sessionID` +
`origin: "submit" | "stash"`; entries from before this change simply have no
tag). The effective Session ID is recorded for submissions created from Home,
not only for prompts sent inside an existing session. `up`/`down` browsing
shows entries from the open session first, then the global ones, and a footer
badge marks what you are looking at: `↑ this session` / `↑ other session`.
Legacy untagged entries use the neutral `↑ history` badge. Drafts that were
never submitted add a `· stashed` suffix. These notices stay visible while a
session is busy or retrying, and clear as soon as you edit the text.

This recovery history is stored in `prompt-history.jsonl` and browsing it does
not consume entries. It is intentionally separate from the explicit
`prompt.stash`, `prompt.stash.pop`, and `prompt.stash.list` commands. Those
commands use the dedicated `prompt-stash.jsonl` stack, where pop/list provide
explicit stash management instead of normal `up`/`down` history navigation.

## 8. Local shell bypass

The existing `!` shortcut remains **Shell** mode: it asks the OpenCode server
to execute the command and the resulting tool call remains auditable in the
session. Press `!` a second time while the shell input is empty to enter
**Local** mode, then type a command such as `pwd` or `code .`.

`!!` is a strict client-side bypass. The TUI starts the command directly in
the current session directory and displays stdout/stderr inline above the
prompt. It does not create a session message, tool result, persistent
prompt-history entry, or model request; the provider therefore receives
neither the command nor its output. ANSI and control sequences are removed
before display. The orange **Local shell** label remains active after each
command.

- Local mode is available for an active session, including when the TUI is
  attached to a remote OpenCode server. The command always runs on the client
  in the reported session directory; a remote server never executes it. If the
  reported directory is unavailable locally, the command fails locally and its
  error is shown inline in Local shell.
- `esc` is the only shortcut that leaves Local shell. It discards the current
  local input and returns to auditable Shell mode; a second `esc` returns to
  the normal prompt.
- Commands have a 30-second limit. On timeout OpenCode terminates the local
  process tree and reports the result without persisting it. `up` and `down`
  navigate a dedicated in-memory Local shell command history. The history is
  cleared by `esc` or a session change; it holds at most 20 commands and shows
  the five most recent outputs inline, with each output preview capped at 8 KiB
  and 12 lines. Interactive or long-running work belongs in a real terminal.
